# HTML 
The purpose of this section is to rebuild my knowledge of HTML from the ground up. The goal is to develop an advanced, modern knowledge base suitable for modern browser applications. 

The following will be areas of focus:

* How HTML works under the hood
* Semantic HTML
* HTML native features (absent frameworks like React, Vue, etc.)
